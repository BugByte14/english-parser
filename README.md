# Welcome to the Sentence Parser 3000!

The Sentence Parser 3000 is a state-of-the-art program designed to take simple English sentences and break apart the parts of speech used. Simply type some text in the textbox below, or upload a text document to be parsed.

## Current limitations:

- The parser does not recognize proper nouns (ie. specific names, locations, etc.).
- Does not account for capitalization, only detects lower-cased words (except for "I").
- Currently does not support irregular word forms (like words with root changes, -ies plural nouns, etc.).

## Currently Supports:

- Over 2,500 of the most common nouns.
- Almost 1,000 of the most common verbs.
- Over 800 adjectives.
- Several of the most common adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and articles.
